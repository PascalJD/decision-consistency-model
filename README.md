# Consistency Model for Decision-Making

Planning with diffusion models has emerged as an effective decision-making paradigm. However, despite its effectiveness, the method is computationally intensive, requiring numerous passes through a deep neural network to generate data from noise. This project introduces a consistency model as an alternative to accelerate the decision-making process, potentially reducing the computational overhead without compromising the quality of the outcomes.

This codebase builds upon the work done of [Michael Janner's diffuser project](https://github.com/jannerm/diffuser/).
